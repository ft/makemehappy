*** TODO cmake: Invoke CMake to configure a build-tree
Sometimes when working on the CMake-system  part of a software module, it might
useful to be able to invoke CMake's configuration step for a certain build tree
at will. This is possible to do manually, of course, but cumbersome, since much
of the build's parameters need to be specified on CMake's command line. And mmh
could figure out all of those for you.

In mmh builds,  all important build specific information is  encoded in the di-
rectory name that mmh generated. This should become the ‘cmake’ sub-command.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# From build directory (assumes top-level in ../..):
% mmh cmake
# From module source directory:
% mmh cmake ci/build/gnu_native_posix_debug_make
# Configure multiple build-trees:
% mmh cmake ci/build/gnu_native_posix_debug_{make,ninja}
#+END_EXAMPLE

All important parameters are encoded in the build-directory name:

- Zephyr: ~zephyr-gnuarmemb_nucleo-f767zi_none_debug_ninja~
- Board: ~gnu_native_posix_debug_make~ (no ~zephyr-~ prefix)
*** ACTIVE system: Build many parameter combinations for a system-build
In normal operation, mmh tries to build  a module's code with as many parameter
combinations as possible (toolchain, build-cfg, build-tool etc). To do this, it
resolves dependencies and  generates a CMake top-level setup to  build and test
the whole affair.

For production software, this level of automation may be undesirable. Maintain-
ers may decide to rather implement this top-level system themselves and instan-
tiate the dependencies on their own as well. Thus a build without these automa-
tion steps is a system-build.  This kind of system-build  is supported by UFW's
CMake extensions.

One of the limitations of CMake is, that a single build can only use one single
toolchain. In embedded development it is  not uncommon having to resort to ven-
dor specific toolchains, thus for complete builds requiring the use of multiple
toolchains to build all applications that belong to a system.

It's actually possible to overcome this, by using CMake's ExternalProject modu-
le and run CMake  in a recursive scheme, so that each  sub-call of cmake confi-
gures a build for a single toolchain,  thus tying everything into a single mas-
sive build. The CMake modules of the UFW library implement this scheme.

This has several downsides: The CMakeLists.txt file becomes tough to follow be-
cause the same  file gets parsed in multiple ways  by multiple CMake processes.
The build tree becomes  complex and quite deep so the  top-level CMake call can
keep track of what is happening. This is rather unergonomic for the user to de-
cent into. And  finally, it becomes tough to perform  parallel build correctly.
If you use  Ninja, for instance an  run your top-level ninja  in parallel mode,
the recursive calls may also be parallel,  which — in complex builds — can mas-
sively overload your system.

UFW's API follows  a pretty declarative approach in  specifying desired builds.
This declaration  can also be done  outside of CMake,  say in a YAML  file, and
instead of  having CMake call CMake  for configuration and have  the build tool
call the  build tool again  recursively for building,  have mmh call  cmake and
then have mmh call the build system as desired.

This has the one  downside, that a build like that  introduces a new dependency
upon mmh.  But on the  plus side, it would  solve all the  previously mentioned
problems. Since mmh would have perfect access to all build parameters, it would
make it easy to implement a pleasant command line interface to build parts of a
large system build as well.

The ‘system’ command  should therefore implement the  functionality provided by
UFW's recursive CMake  calling scheme. The UFW library could  be updated accor-
dingly, because  the CMake code  required for  this is not  particularly pretty
either. This could be done for UFW 2.0.0,  at which point we could also break a
couple of things that require inelegant code to implement.
** TODO Implement version dependency judgements
** TODO Add options to override dependency versions
It would be best to be able to put the option more than once and for it to use
patterns. So --dep-version "PATTERN=VERSIONTHING", for example:

  mmh --dep-version "*=master" build

…to build a module with all dependency versions set to ‘master’.
** TODO Add a way to define dependencies for third-party modules
** TODO Flesh out user manual
** TODO Data read from YAML files should be verified
If we don't, we need to check tons of conditions at the points the data is
actually used. Checking data upfront allows us to write much more straight
forward code.
** DONE Remove Interface Definition
** TODO Use slash (/) as a delimiter in module build instances
Doing this works well in system builds, as there is no need to transform
certain characters in some parts (like _ → - in zephyr board names). So in
order to increase consistency the module build facility will use a scheme
similar to the one used by the system builds.
** DONE Detect cyclic dependencies in toplevel CMakeLists.txt
** DONE Add YamlStack variant for configuration parsing
** DONE Add option to keep running when a build-instance fails
CLOSED: [2022-05-08 Sun 12:55]
** DONE With non-temporary build-roots, invert --preserve
** DONE Generate mmh script
Configure:
- Python path
- Data directory (`/usr/share/MakeMeHappy`)
- Config directory (`/etc/MakeMeHappy`)
** DONE Add Debian Packaging
** DONE Allow the user to specify a subset of all defined build instances
If the module.yaml file defines 40 or 50 possible combinations of toolchains,
build configurations, tools and the like, it would be useful to pick from
those.
** DONE Record initial command line args in buildroot/makemehappy.yaml
That way you can set up a complex run once and never have to do that in later
runs again. Add another command to reset/replace previously recorded command
line arguments.
** DONE Allow handing command line arguments to cmake in instance runs
Lets do this:

  mmh [ARGS] [COMMAND-WITH-ARGS...] [-- CMAKE-ARGUMENTS]

That it's possible to run different variants of builds, if the module's build
system allows or requires that.
** DONE Add a second value kind to variables: defaults
This:

  variables:
    FOOBAR: something

…continues to generate this:

  set(FOOBAR, "something")

…while…

  defaults:
    FOOBAR: something

…generates this:

  if (NOT FOOBAR)
    set(FOOBAR, "something")
  endif()

This may be useful in conjunction with passing through cmake arguments:

  mmh -d ci -- -DFOOBAR=something-else

In order to *optionally* run different variants of a build.
** DONE In extension generation, an implementing module should be optional
It is possible that extensions rely on a certain way to use a CMake built-in
facility without requiring an additional module to be included. The include
step should therefore be optional.
** DONE Allow extensions to use add_subdirectory
We might want to be able to do something along the lines of this:

cmake-extensions:
  some-board-definition-module:
   include: add_subdirectory(deps/${moduleroot}/${cmake('TARGET_BOARD')})

To generate this:

   add_subdirectory(deps/some-board-definition-module/${TARGET_BOARD})

This allows using collections of modules in a meta-module. There are certainly
other ways to achieve something similar, but this is easily done, so we should
allow for it.
** DONE Add a separate initialisation clause for cmake extensions
Some modules may need a separate initialisation step that extends whatever the
inclusion step does.

mymod:
  include: add_libtap(${moduleroot})
  init: init_my_module()
  module: MyModSupport

This will be more powerful with generation-waypoints in place. See below.
** DONE Introduce waypoints that for extension generation
CLOSED: [2022-05-08 Sun 12:49]
With third party extensions you get a way of replacing add_subdirectory() calls
with arbitrary cmake functions or macros. The generation of that looks like
this:

   include(ModuleThatImplementsExtension)
   add_thisextension(deps/thisextension)

If you need to push the generation of ~add_thisextension()~ pack until
something else has happened, however, there is currently no way to achieve
that. With way points, it would be possible to make ~add_thisextension()~
create a ~pre-inclusion~ waypoint and any extensions registered to it, would
generate their code before this waypoint. The possible waypoint variants should
be this:

- pre-module
- post-module
- pre-inclusion
- post-inclusion
- pre-initialisation
- post-initialisation

This is more complex of a problem, especially with module interdependencies to
be considered. Some third-party modules, that border upon having circular
dependencies can't really be used without something like this.

The ‘basic’ and ‘init’ steps were added a while ago. This should be good enough
for the time being.
** DONE Make it possible for an extension to be used by more than one module
cmake-extensions:
  mymod:
    include: add_libtap(${moduleroot})
    init: init_my_module()
    module: MyModSupport

cmake-extension-variants:
  # Explicit list:
  mymod:
    - mymod-a
    - mymod-b
    - mymod-c
  # Also, maybe via pattern:
  mymod: ^mymod-.*$
** DONE Allow source types other than git; symlinks especially
CLOSED: [2022-05-08 Sun 12:43]
Allowing symlinks gives users the ability to inject ongoing development of
modules into the dependency chain of other modules, making it possible to
develop modules side by side.

Symlink type was implemented pre-v0.10.
