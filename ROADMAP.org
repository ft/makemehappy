* Main objectives
** DONE Really generate toplevel CMakeLists.txt
** DONE Add support for extending CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
** DONE Make dependency fetcher build its dep-trace correctly
** DONE Write output to log
** DONE Write log to log file
** DONE Handle external program return codes correctly
** DONE Run all configured build-instances
…not just the default native build using make.
** DONE Determine inclusion-order for toplevel CMakeLists.txt
* Secondary
** DONE Detect cyclic dependencies in toplevel CMakeLists.txt
** TODO Implement version dependency judgements
** TODO Add more sub-commands
*** TODO Run compilation instances from build-tree
- [X] All
- [ ] One
- [ ] Some
** TODO Add options to override dependency versions
It would be best to be able to put the option more than once and for it to use
patterns. So --dep-version "PATTERN=VERSIONTHING", for example:

  mmh --dep-version "*=master" build

…to build a module with all dependency versions set to ‘master’.
** DONE Add YamlStack variant for configuration parsing
** TODO Add option to keep running when a build-instance fails
** TODO Add a way to define dependencies for third-party modules
** DONE With non-temporary build-roots, invert --preserve
** DONE Generate mmh script
Configure:
- Python path
- Data directory (`/usr/share/MakeMeHappy`)
- Config directory (`/etc/MakeMeHappy`)
** DONE Add Debian Packaging
** TODO Flesh out user manual
** TODO Data read from YAML files should be verified
If we don't, we need to check tons of conditions at the points the data is
actually used. Checking data upfront allows us to write much more straight
forward code.
** DONE Allow the user to specify a subset of all defined build instances
If the module.yaml file defines 40 or 50 possible combinations of toolchains,
build configurations, tools and the like, it would be useful to pick from
those.
** DONE Record initial command line args in buildroot/makemehappy.yaml
That way you can set up a complex run once and never have to do that in later
runs again. Add another command to reset/replace previously recorded command
line arguments.
** DONE Allow handing command line arguments to cmake in instance runs
Lets do this:

  mmh [ARGS] [COMMAND-WITH-ARGS...] [-- CMAKE-ARGUMENTS]

That it's possible to run different variants of builds, if the module's build
system allows or requires that.
** TODO Allow handing a directory into "run" command
That way we could rerun a specific instance without having to manually listing
all characteristics of that instance.
** DONE Add a second value kind to variables: defaults
This:

  variables:
    FOOBAR: something

…continues to generate this:

  set(FOOBAR, "something")

…while…

  defaults:
    FOOBAR: something

…generates this:

  if (NOT FOOBAR)
    set(FOOBAR, "something")
  endif()

This may be useful in conjunction with passing through cmake arguments:

  mmh -d ci -- -DFOOBAR=something-else

In order to *optionally* run different variants of a build.
** TODO In extension generation, an implementing module should be optional
It is possible that extensions rely on a certain way to use a CMake built-in
facility without requiring an additional module to be included. The include
step should therefore be optional.
** TODO Allow extensions to use add_subdirectory
We might want to be able to do something along the lines of this:

cmake-extensions:
  some-board-definition-module:
   include: add_subdirectory(deps/some-board-definition-module/${cmake[TARGET_BOARD]})

To generate this:

   add_subdirectory(deps/some-board-definition-module/${TARGET_BOARD})

This allows using collections of modules in a meta-module. There are certainly
other ways to achieve something similar, but this is easily done, so we should
allow for it.
** TODO Add a separate initialisation clause for cmake extensions
Some modules may need a separate initialisation step that extends whatever the
inclusion step does.

mymod:
  include: add_libtap(${moduleroot})
  init: init_my_module()
  module: MyModSupport

This will be more powerful with generation-waypoints in places. See below.
** TODO Introduce waypoints that for extension generation
With third party extensions you get a way of replacing add_subdirectory() calls
with arbitrary cmake functions or macros. The generation of that looks like
this:

   include(ModuleThatImplementsExtension)
   add_thisextension(deps/thisextension)

If you need to push the generation of ~add_thisextension()~ pack until
something else has happened, however, there is currently no way to achieve
that. With way points, it would be possible to make ~add_thisextension()~
create a ~pre-inclusion~ waypoint and any extensions registered to it, would
generate their code before this waypoint. The possible waypoint variants should
be this:

- pre-module
- post-module
- pre-inclusion
- post-inclusion
- pre-initialisation
- post-initialisation

This is more complex of a problem, especially with module interdependencies to
be considered. Some third-party modules, that border upon having circular
dependencies can't really be used without something like this.
* Wishlist
** DONE Forget "tools" — check all dependencies into "deps"
** TODO Zsh completion would be nice
** ACTIVE Gather statistics while running
*** TODO How many dependency versions had a patch-level mismatch?
*** TODO How many dependency versions had a minor mismatch?
*** TODO How many dependency versions had a major mismatch?
*** DONE How many build-instances succeeded/failed?
*** DONE How many build-instances had their test runs succeed/fail?
*** DONE How much time did individual steps take to execute?
*** DONE Render statistics nicely at program termination
