# NAME

mmh - MakeMeHappy - Module Build Automation Tool


# SYNOPSIS

`mmh [-h] [-d DIRECTORY] [-m MODULE] [-p] [-s SOURCE] [-V] [-v] CMD... [++ CMAKE-PARAMs...]`


# DESCRIPTION

`mmh` is a tool to automatically arrange a build-environment to build modular
software projects. It is mostly aimed at languages like C and C++, that
otherwise lack a wide-spread module system. In order for this to work, `mmh`
uses CMake as its underlying build system. With CMake based modules, it can
work out-of-the box, mostly. For non-CMake based projects, it puts in place a
couple of facilities to help incorporate them. `mmh` is mostly meant to be used
with embedded projects in mind, and was mostly developed for use with the `ufw`
library.

## Motivation

One possible approach to assemble larger software projects is to split logical
parts into modules, create APIs and use multiple modules that, in combination,
create a larger, more complex application or library. The Git version control
system allows the assembly of precise states of such modules via its submodule
system.

Building such super projects is trivial, because — **by** **design** — the
super project incorporates *all* required modules with all of their
dependencies. Using CMake at the top-level of the super project makes it fairly
easy to use the different modules, as instantiated by Git's submodule system,
as well. The approach is very flexible and has the upside of enforcing API
discipline as well.

A problem, that arises from this approach however, is the building a *single*
module. This is very common, especially with version control and continuous
integration in place, where it is desirable to build a module and run its test
suite any time a developer pushes/commits into the module's repository.

This is where `mmh` comes into play. You can think of it as a tool that, given
enough information, can generate an ephemeral kind of a super project, that
includes the current state of a module with all its dependencies (as well as
all recursive dependencies), and a top-level CMakeLists.txt that would build
the dependencies, followed by the module itself. In addition, `mmh` supports
exercising this build-tree using a combination or one or many `toolchains`,
`architectures`, `buildconfigs`, `buildtools` and `interfaces`. All of that is
powered by a layered configuration approach, that allows for fine-grained
control of all of these parameters as well as module sources.

## General Operations

`mmh`'s default mode of operation is to check out a module and its dependencies
on the fly, configure, build and optionally run its test-suite and report back
the result of all builds it carried out. All this is ephemeral, so the
generated build-tree is removed after `mmh` is done. This behaviour can be
altered, of course, but this default mode of operation is taken, if `mmh` is
called in a modules source directory, without any command like parameters at
all. This is the effect of the `build` sub-command, that serves as `mmh`'s the
default.

The `build` command works in a number of steps:

- Initialise a build-tree.
- Fetch the target module's dependencies recursively.
- Generate a top-level build-system that uses CMake.
- Build one or *many* instances based on combinations of build-parameters in
  dedicated build-trees, collecting statistics in the process.
- Finally print a summary of the collected build-statistics.

The available toolchains are based upon CMake's toolchain-files and the default
set of supported toolchains is based on `ufw`'s set of such toolchain-files.


# EXAMPLES

Building a module is predicated on the existence of a file called
`module.yaml`. With it in place, you can run a combined build of all build
instances like this:

    % mmh

…which is exactly equivalent to this:

    % mmh build

With that, the default behaviour will run the builds, summarise how the process
went and remove the build tree created afterwards. In order to keep the build
tree around, you can name a specific directory to use instead:

    % mmh -d ci

…which does the same operation as before, but instead of using a temporary
directory that gets removed afterward, use the directory named `ci` and keep it
around after running all instances.

If this is done with all default settings and the `ufw` library as the target
module, `mmh` will try and run forty(!) build instances. This exercised the
code base with a lot of compilers, build-tools and build settings, but can take
a bit of time. `mmh` allows users to optionally pick the respective sets of all
these parameters. For example, to only use `ninja` as a build tool, `gnu` and
`clang` as toolchains and `debug` and `release`, you can do the following:

    % mmh -d ci -T gnu,clang -B ninja -C release,debug

…bringing down the number of instances to four instead of forty. You can also
hand additional parameters to each configuration call to `cmake` using `++`
followed by a list of such parameters at the end of a `mmh build` call:

    % mmh -d ci -T gnu,clang -B ninja -C release,debug ++ -DAAA=aaa -DBBB=bbb

With calls like this, `mmh` records the set of parameters used in a file in the
generated build-tree, so that re-running the same build is as easy as this:

    % mmh -d ci run-instance
