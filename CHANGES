 User-visible changes in make-me-happy
=======================================

* v0.29 → v0.30 (unreleased):

This release adds an experimental feature: The "evaluate" key for use in module
and system specs. This features aims to  make mmh more flexible by allowing the
user to inject python code into the operation of the program.

With this it is  possible to register code with certain  points in the executed
of mmh.  These are called  "hooks", and they are  available in both  module and
system type builds. Secondly, in system  builds, it is possible to specify code
that is  executed when a  set of build-steps are  completed, to allow  users to
perform  actions to  combine such  sub-results  into a  combined results.  This
injectable code is called "combinations".

Both hooks and combinations are experimental  features. Their API is subject to
change. Additionally, it has to be  noted that while this code injection allows
for basically full access to the core of mmh, this should not be abused: Do not
change internal information,  and do not depend on  internal information. mmh's
internals are not particularly cleanly abstracted in a modular fashion, and are
subject to change. Dependable APIs for hooks and combinations will be specified
in the future.

** Bugfixes

- run-instance: Fix cwd for inspecting log file.
- prepare: Allow calling sub-command multiple times.
- list-instances: Don't try to run if build-directory does not exist.

- Show a progress report with each line of --show-phases output.
- New root query-type.
- New root-module query-type.
- New root-system query-type.

  single string.

* v0.15 → v0.16 (released 2023-01-21):

** Breaking Compatibility:

- The default command is switched to 'run-instance' when mmh is not in system
  mode and the specified directory (via --directory) already exists. Previously
  mmh still defaulted to 'build', which breaks with the directory exists.
- Configuration and source definitions inherit properties from layers with less
  priority. This means, that you cannot just override a definition. To remove
  any inherited data, use the new ‘remove’ top-level key.

** New Features

- Support removing specifications from lower priority files in the yaml stacks
  at merge-time.
- Allow adding configuration profiles to the config stack, using --config.
- Allow adding source definitions to the source stack, using --source.
- Implement loading west.yml after setting up zephyr-kernel module.
- Inherit west-based revisions specifications for zephyr modules, that do not
  specify a revision in a module's dependency list.
- Add a main-parameter to source definitions, specifying a module's main
  development branch.
- Implement revision-overrides by file-glob style patterns. This allows
  specifying a fixed revision or the use of a module's development branch.
- Implement revision-overrides by --revision option on the command line.
- Implement foo/bar/*/baz style instance filters for module builds.
- Add ‘prepare’ subcommand that completely initialises a build tree, ready to
  be used by ‘run-instance’.
- Add ‘list-instances’ command to list module build instances.

** Bugfixes

- Process --query at a time where more information is established.

** Miscellaneous

- Merge all yaml-stack layers after loading instead of doing it when required
  at ‘lookup’ time.
- Removed a couple of obsolete zephyr modules: zephyr-hal-qmsi,
  zephyr-hal-unisoc and zephyr-mcumgr.

* v0.13 → v0.14 (released 2022-11-02):

** New Features

- Allow selecting CMake components for installation. The ‘install’ key can be
  either ‘true’ or ‘false’ to enable/disable installation; when it is another
  string or a list of strings, mmh will trigger the names CMake components.
  This, for instance, works with ufw's ‘ufw-git-install’ component. But any
  other components your build declares will work as well.
- Add ‘--full’ option to ‘show-result’: This will output the entire data from a
  given log file stripping the per-line log-prefix.
- Add phase information to logging output as well.
- sources: Add ‘zephyr-picolibc’ module.
- sources: Add ‘ufwz’ module.

** Bugfixes

- Fix using ‘common’ section from ‘system.yaml’.
- show-phases: Force output after printing phase name.

  repository's root-directory.

* v0.10 → v0.11 (released 2022-06-03):

** Breaking Compatibility:

- Removed ‘download’ alias for ‘download-source’. Use ‘get’ instead.
- Modules using ‘zephyr’ type now have to use ‘toolchains’ and ‘boards’ instead
  of ‘toolchain’ and ‘board’ for improved consistency with the new ‘system’
  sub-command's behaviour.
- Build-directories of modules now use slashes (/) as delimiters between
  instance parameters, like toolchain, build-config and the like. This is also
  to improve consistency with the build-directory trees used by the ‘system’
  command, but also removes the need for some ugly transfomations like
  replacing all underscores by dashes in zephyr board names.
- The ‘interface’ parameter for build instances was removed.
- This release requires the upcoming 2.0.0 version of ufw.

** New Features

- New ‘system’ sub-command: Building many instances of system pre-defined
  outside of mmh; for instance via git-submodules. This is a replacement for
  the recursive CMake execution scheme implemented by ufw in order to support
  more than one C/C++ toolchain in CMake.
- New zsh completion definition (compsys): _makemehappy.

** Bugfixes

- Fix installation step in systems that do not install any artefacts.
- Fix installation step in execution statistics.

* v0.1 → v0.2 (released 2019-06-26):

** New Features:

- Execution statistics are gathered and summarised upon program termination
  (61a0483).

- Exit status now depends on the combined results of all build instances. Only
  if all instances succeed, does mmh return success (45c3f5b2).

- Tool definitions are now taken from configuration (however, modules can still
  override — a602f888).

- Handle output correctly; per default external programs don't push their
  output through logging facility. This can be forced, though. All output can
  also be dumped to file, in which case all output goes through the logging
  facility as well (63927123).
